# VirtualMarriageRegistrar backend


An object-oriented programming paradigm was chosen
for the development of the application. 
When creating the application, a three-tier client-server 
architecture was used. The three-tier client-server architecture
consists of:
* basic client layer - the frontend part of the application that represents the GUI for interacting with the end user and that sends  requests to the middle layer of the application,
* application web server - the middle layer of the application (backend part) in which the complete logic of the application is located and which communicates with the database server and
* database server - stores and provides the necessary data.

The client layer of the application was created using the *Angular*
web application development platform. The program code is written
in the *Visual Studio Code* editor. Code for frontend layer is placed on repository named "VirtualMarriageRegistrar_Frontend-master"
The application web server is created as a *Spring Boot* application written
in the *Java* programming language. 
The development environment *Intellij IDEA* was used. 
Relational database was benefit which had been created in *Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio*. 
JPA, and his implementation Hibernate, was used for ORM.
